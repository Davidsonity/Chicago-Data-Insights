## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing three datasets related to Chicago: Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago, Chicago Public Schools, and Chicago Crime Data. The goal is to gain insights and make data-driven decisions based on the analysis of these datasets.

## Repository Contents

The repository contains the following files:

1. `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup, and details about the datasets and analysis.
2. `notebook.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code and analysis for the project. It includes SQL queries to load the datasets into an IBM DB2 database and perform various data analysis tasks.

## Datasets

The datasets used in this project are available on the city of Chicago's Data Portal. They can be downloaded as CSV files from the following links:

1. [Chicago Census Data](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera_V5/data/ChicagoCensusData.csv)
2. [Chicago Public Schools](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera_V5/data/ChicagoPublicSchools.csv)
3. [Chicago Crime Data](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera_V5/data/ChicagoCrimeData.csv)

## Setup Instructions

To replicate the analysis and run SQL queries on the datasets, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have access to an IBM DB2 database.
2. Download the three datasets mentioned above.
3. Import the datasets into the DB2 database as separate tables using the provided CSV files.
4. Open the `notebook.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
5. Connect to the DB2 database using the appropriate credentials.
6. Execute the SQL queries provided in the notebook to perform the desired analysis.

## Analysis

The `notebook.ipynb` file contains the code and SQL queries necessary to perform the analysis on the datasets. It provides a step-by-step guide for loading the datasets into the DB2 database and conducting various data analysis tasks.

Here are a few examples of analysis tasks that can be performed:

1. Identifying the Chicago community areas with the highest and lowest socioeconomic indicators.
2. Evaluating the relationship between socioeconomic indicators and school performance in Chicago.
3. Analyzing crime trends over time and identifying areas with high crime rates.
4. Investigating any correlations between socioeconomic factors and crime rates in different community areas.

Feel free to explore the datasets and customize the analysis according to your needs and interests.

## Conclusion

By analyzing the Socioeconomic Indicators, Chicago Public Schools, and Chicago Crime Data, this project aims to provide insights into various aspects of Chicago's communities, education system, and crime rates. The use of SQL queries on an IBM DB2 database allows for efficient analysis and data-driven decision-making.

Please refer to the provided datasets, set up the DB2 database accordingly, and execute the SQL queries in the `notebook.ipynb` file to explore and analyze the data.

**Note:** It is recommended to read the README.md file before proceeding to the notebook for a better understanding of the project and its setup.
